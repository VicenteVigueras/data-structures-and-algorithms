Getting better at DSA and problem solving that's all...
Working directly on main so what?

----

Current State:
1. Randomly picked leetcode problems mainly focused on linkedlists and solved them using Java

What can I do better:
1. Project lacks structure.
2. It could be grouped by algorithm pattern (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, etc) or by Data Structure.
3. Project is dependent of leetcode. The viewer of this repo needs to go into leetcode, copy-paste my solution, and run. Otherwise it doesn't make sense.
